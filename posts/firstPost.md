# Hello, world! (Like, seriously, HELLO!)

After working on this website on-and-off for a month, I was finally able to push it online. 

This is my first hand-coded personal website. I'm planning to add more and more features in future. 

The site looks pretty simple right now. It only has some minimal styling with a markdown blog.

As I just entered the world of development, I hope to share all my joy and sweats in my coding journry. I am a self-taught developer. There are lots of learnings I would like to share with other developers.
